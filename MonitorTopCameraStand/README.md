# Monitor Top Camera Stand

This is a shelf designed to fit atop most computer monitors that will allow users to place a camera not originally designed to be mounted on top of a monitor, such as an Xbox Kinect.

This includes the SolidWorks part so that individuals can make their own improvements, as well as the STL file for immediate printing.
